Week 11:
Continued working on the Communities page. Got the sorting working so users can now toggle between "Latest" and "Most Liked" views. The backend is handling the sorting properly.
Removed the Messages feature completely since we decided it wasn't essential for the project anymore. Cleaned up all the related code, routes, and removed it from the sidebar. That simplified things a bit.
Worked on improving the post display, made the cards look better and added proper spacing. Also fixed the navigation so clicking on a post takes you to the detail page properly.
Next we will start thinking about the Progress page redesign. The current implementation is a bit clunky and we want to make it more organized by grouping exercises by workout day. Next week problem tho.
