Week 14:
Finalized UI polish across all pages including Clusters, Communities, Progress, Settings, and Workouts. Updated the exercise autocomplete functionality in the Progress page to include additional exercises such as cable glute kickback, cable step-up, smith machine hip thrust, and smith machine RDL. Replaced the README.md file with a comprehensive version that includes clear setup instructions, main functionality descriptions, and the embedded demo video link. The application is now fully polished and ready for final submission with all features complete and documentation updated.
