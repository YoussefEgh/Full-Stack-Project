Week 1 (10/7 – 10/13):
We met up as a team to discuss our Figma designs and wireframes. During this time, we planned out how each screen should look and flow, finalized the structure of the app, and ensured everyone understood their design responsibilities.

Week 2 (10/14 – 10/20):
We began setting up the development environment and tinkering with the initial project setup. This included configuring repositories, connecting frontend and backend frameworks, and beginning the first stages of programming.

Week 3 (10/21 – 10/23):
Over the past week, our group made significant progress on both the frontend and backend of our application. We successfully added multiple core pages and implemented smooth navigation across the platform using a sidebar layout.

On the frontend, we completed the setup of the main sidebar navigation system, which now connects all major pages of the app: Home, Workouts, Progress, Messages, Communities, and Settings. The sidebar provides consistent access and clean transitions between components. The Workouts page was implemented to allow users to create, view, and manage their workout routines, while the Progress page enables users to log and track sets, reps, and weights dynamically.

On the backend, we nearly finalized the login page and continued structuring user-related functionality. The Settings page was expanded with personalized user controls, allowing management of profile details, profile pictures, measurement units (kg/lb), personal stats like weight and height, and data management features such as exporting or deleting progress data—giving users full control over their app experience.

Additionally, we began structuring the new Communities and Messages pages by setting up React routes, layout structures, and placeholders for future social and communication features. Overall, the group made strong progress toward completing the main functionality of the app.
