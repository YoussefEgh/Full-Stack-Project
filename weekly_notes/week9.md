**Week 1: Wednesday, Oct. 22**
Over the past week, our group made significant progress on both the frontend and backend of our application. We successfully added multiple core pages and implemented smooth navigation across the platform using a sidebar layout. On the frontend, we completed the setup of the main sidebar navigation system, which now connects all major pages of the app: Home, Workouts, Progress, Messages, Communities, and Settings. The sidebar provides consistent access and clean transitions between components. We also almost finalized the login page in the backend. The Workouts page was implemented to allow users to create, view, and manage their workout routines, while the Progress page enables users to log and track sets, reps, and weights dynamically. The Settings page was expanded with personalized user controls, allowing management of profile details, profile pictures, measurement units (kg/lb), personal stats like weight and height, and data management features such as exporting or deleting progress data. This gives users complete control over their app experience. In addition, we began structuring the new Communities and Messages pages, setting up React routes, layout structure, and placeholders for future social and communication features. Overall, the group made strong progress toward completing the main functionality of the app.
